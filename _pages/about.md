I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), 
working with [Takashi Tomita](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/laboratory/ngdi/tomita.html) and [Toshiaki Aoki](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/laboratory/ngdi/aoki.html). 
I was fortunate to be supervised by [Kazuhiro Ogata](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/~ogata/), 
earning my PhD in Sep 2023 and continuing as a postdoctoral researcher in his lab until May 2024.

My research interests lie in the practical application of formal methods to real-world problems and systems. 
Currently, in the research group led by [Toshiaki Aoki](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/laboratory/ngdi/aoki.html)
and [Takashi Tomita](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/laboratory/ngdi/tomita.html), 
we are working on the [Formal Method and Autonomous Driving](https://fomaad.github.io/) project, 
which focuses on leveraging formal methods to verify next-generation automotive systems, including autonomous driving systems.
