I am a postdoctoral researcher at Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), working with [Takashi Tomita](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/laboratory/ngdi/tomita.html) and [Toshiaki Aoki](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/laboratory/ngdi/aoki.html). I was fortunately supervised by [Kazuhiro Ogata](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/~ogata/),
getting my PhD in 2023 and doing a postdoc there until May 2024.

My research interest lies in practical application of formal method to real-world problems and systems. 
Currently, in the [Toshiaki Aoki](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/laboratory/ngdi/aoki.html)
and [Takashi Tomita](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/laboratory/ngdi/tomita.html) research group, we are conducting the research project [Formal Method and Autonomous Driving](https://fomaad.github.io/), focusing on leveraging formal method techniques to verify next-generation automative systems, including autonomous driving systems.
